\f[C]memavaild\f[] \- Daemon that keeps amount of available memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]memavaild\f[] [\f[B]OPTION\f[]]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]memavaild\f[] is a daemon that tries to keep amount of available
memory to improve system responsiveness during heavy swapping.
.PP
Default behavior: the control groups specified in the config
(\f[C]user.slice\f[] and \f[C]system.slice\f[]) are swapped out when
MemAvailable is low by reducing \f[C]memory.high\f[] (values change
dynamically).
memavaild tries to keep about 3% available memory.
.PP
Effects: tasks are performed at less I/O and memory pressure (and this
may be detected by PSI metrics).
At the same time, performance may be increased in tasks that requires
heavy swapping, especially in I/O bound tasks.
Using memavaild has no effect without swap space.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
.IP \[bu] 2
Python (>= 3.3)
.IP \[bu] 2
systemd with unified cgroup hierarchy
.SH Known problems
.IP \[bu] 2
The documentation is terrible (no config keys description, for example);
.IP \[bu] 2
The ZFS ARC cache is memory\-reclaimable, like the Linux buffer cache.
However, in contrast to the buffer cache, it currently does not count to
MemAvailable (see <https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/10255>).
Don\[aq]t use memavaild with ZFS;
.IP \[bu] 2
Seems like \f[C]memavaild\f[] violates the second
rule (https://systemd.io/CGROUP_DELEGATION/): \f[C]memavaild\f[]
manipulates the attributes of cgroups created by systemd
(\f[C]memavaild\f[] changes \f[C]memory.high\f[] values).
