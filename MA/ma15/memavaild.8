.PP
memavaild \- Daemon that keeps amount of available memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]memavaild\f[] [\f[B]OPTION\f[]]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
memavaild is a daemon that tries to keep amount of available memory to
improve system responsiveness during heavy swapping.
.PP
Default behavior: the control groups specified in the config (user.slice
and system.slice) are swapped out when MemAvailable is low by reducing
memory.high (values change dynamically).
memavaild tries to keep about 3% available memory.
.PP
Effects: tasks are performed at less I/O and memory pressure (and this
may be detected by PSI metrics).
At the same time, performance may be increased in tasks that requires
heavy swapping, especially in I/O bound tasks.
Using memavaild has no effect without swap space.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
.IP \[bu] 2
Python (>= 3.3)
.IP \[bu] 2
systemd with unified cgroup hierarchy
.SH Known problems
.PP
The ZFS ARC cache is memory\-reclaimable, like the Linux buffer cache.
However, in contrast to the buffer cache, it currently does not count to
MemAvailable (see <https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/10255>).
Don\[aq]t use memavaild with ZFS.
