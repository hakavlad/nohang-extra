+unevictable_activefile_kbytes
+=============================
+
+How many kilobytes of `Active(file)` to never evict during high-pressure
+low-memory situations. ie. never evict active file pages if under this value.
+This will help prevent disk thrashing caused by Active(file) being close to zero
+in such situations, especially when no swap is used.
+
+As 'nivedita' (phoronix user) put it:
+"Executables and shared libraries are paged into memory, and can be paged out
+even with no swap. [...] The kernel is dumping those pages and [...] immediately
+reading them back in when execution continues."
+^ and that's what's causing the disk thrashing during memory pressure.
+
+unevictable_activefile_kbytes=X will prevent X kbytes of those most used pages
+from being evicted.
+
+The default value is 65536. That's 64 MiB.
+
+Set it to 0 to keep the default behaviour, as if this option was never
+implemented, so you can see the disk thrashing as usual.
+
+To get an idea what value to use here for your workload(eg. xfce4 with idle
+terminals) to not disk thrash at all, run this::
+
+	$ echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; grep -F 'Active(file)' /proc/meminfo
+	1
+	Active(file):     203444 kB
+
+so, using vm.unevictable_activefile_kbytes=203444 would be a good idea here.
+(you can even add a `sleep` before the grep to get a slightly increased value,
+which might be useful if something is compiling in the background and you want
+to account for that too)
+
+But you can probably go with the default value of just 65536 (aka 64 MiB)
+as this will eliminate most disk thrashing anyway, unless you're not using
+an SSD, in which case it might still be noticeable (I'm guessing?).
+
+Note that `echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches` can still cause
+Active(file) to go a under the vm.unevictable_activefile_kbytes value.
+It's not an issue and this is how you know how much the value for
+vm.unevictable_activefile_kbytes should be, at the time/workload when you ran it.
+
+The value of `Active(file)` can be gotten in two ways::
+
+	$ grep -F 'Active(file)' /proc/meminfo
+	Active(file):    2712004 kB
+
+and::
+
+	$ grep nr_active_file /proc/vmstat
+	nr_active_file 678001
+
+and multiply that with MAX_NR_ZONES (which is 4), ie. `nr_active_file * MAX_NR_ZONES`
+so 678001*4=2712004  kB
+
+MAX_NR_ZONES is 4 as per:
+`include/generated/bounds.h:10:#define MAX_NR_ZONES 4 /* __MAX_NR_ZONES */`
+and is unlikely the change in the future.
+

+	  due to the disk thrashing(disk reading only) that occurrs because the running
+	  executables's code is being evicted during low-mem conditions which is

+	  This is the default value(in KiB) that vm.unevictable_activefile_kbytes gets.
+	  A value of at least 65536 or at most 262144 is recommended for users
+	  of xfce4 to avoid disk thrashing on low-memory/memory-pressure conditions,
+	  ie. mouse freeze with constant disk activity (but you can still sysrq+f to
+	  trigger oom-killer though, even without this mitigation)
+	  
+	  You can still sysctl set vm.unevictable_activefile_kbytes to a value of 0
+	  to disable this whole feature at runtime.
